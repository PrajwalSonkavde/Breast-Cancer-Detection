-> have to detect outlier (decision tree is finalized use decision tree)
-> if your using then use feature scaling and normalize data , get high accuracy (not required for decision tree)
-> use class and methods 
-> use confusion matrix and classification (done)
-> give a hit and try on roc auc (not required as here only one model will be being used)
-> if your using only decision tree then use random forest (done)
-> if you want to use both decision tree and random forest then use bagging (not required)
-> give a hit and try with svm (low accuracy d, don't think so accuracy will be good)
-> if your using regression or knn and then use pca  (not required , no use of regression models)
-> use new libraries ( done)
-> interpret the model (no need)
-> if your using regression then check multi-collinearity (not required , not using regression model)
